# LED Lighting and Random Shutdown using Assembly and Vbuddy

## Overview

This file demonstrates controlling LEDs connected via the Vbuddy to show F1 light using a RISC-V assembly program. The program gradually illuminates a set of LEDs from a minimal configuration (one LED lit) up to all LEDs fully lit (0xFF), then turns them off after a random interval. The randomness is derived from a simple Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) implemented in assembly.

## Key Components

- **Assembly Code**: [F1Assembly.s](../tb/asm/F1Assembly.s) implements the core LED control logic and random delay generation.
- **Vbuddy Interface (vbuddy.cpp)**: Used to visualize the LED values on a host machine.
- **Verilator Testbench (testbench.h, f1_tb.cpp)**: Simulates the CPU running the assembly code, drives the clock, reset, and displays the state of `a0` (LED output) in Vbuddy.

## How It Works

### LED Lighting Sequence

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - The register `a0` is used to represent LED states. Each bit in `a0` corresponds to an LED.
   - Initially, the code starts by displaying a minimal pattern of LEDs (0x01) and then progressively lights more LEDs.

2. **Gradual Brightening**:
   The assembly subroutine iterates through these values:
   - `0x01` → `0x03` → `0x07` → `0x0F` → `0x1F` → `0x3F` → `0x7F` → `0xFF`
   
   Each step illuminates more LEDs. The delays between steps are introduced by simple countdown loops. For example, after loading `0x01` into `a0`, the code runs a small delay loop to hold that value before moving on.

3. **Full Illumination**:
   Once `a0` = `0xFF`, all LEDs are lit. At this point, the code enters a secondary delay loop that is controlled by a counter (`t3`) and a randomly generated threshold (`t4`).

### Random Shutdown Timing (LFSR)

- **Linear Feedback Shift Register**: The code uses a register `t4` seeded with a nonzero value (e.g., `30`) to produce pseudo-random delays.
- **Updating the LFSR**:
  1. The least significant bit of `t4` is extracted.
  2. `t4` is shifted, and a feedback bit is computed and reinserted at the most significant position.
  3. The result is masked to keep only the lower bits, ensuring a bounded random output.
  
- **Mapping Random Output to Delay**:
  After updating `t4`, the code adds a base offset and scales it to produce a final delay count in a suitable range (e.g., [5..12] cycles).
  
- **Enforcing the Random Delay**:
  The code loops, incrementing `t3` until it reaches `t4`. Only then does it break out of the loop and turn off all LEDs.

### Turning Off the LEDs

When the random delay threshold is reached, the code sets `a0` to `0x00`, turning off all LEDs. Then it recalculates a new random delay (via the LFSR logic) and restarts the cycle:
Initially `turn_off` loop is parallel with subroutine in the main loop, now it is placed directly after the last LED on inside the subroutine.
```
delay7:
    addi    t1, t1, -1
    bne     t1, zero, delay7

    # At this point, a0 = 0xff
    addi    a0, zero, 0xff

# New loop added here:
sub_delay_loop:
    addi    t3, t3, 1            # Increment t3 by 2
    bge     t3, t4, turn_off     # If t3 >= t4, jump directly to turn_off (in main)
    j       sub_delay_loop       # Otherwise, keep looping

    # If we ever exit this loop normally (which we won't in this code), we would return here:
    ret
```
- Reset delay counters.
- Jump back to the start of the `loop` label in `main`.
- Lights again start from a minimal pattern and gradually illuminate all LEDs, only to turn them off after another random delay period.

## Simulation Environment (Testbench)

- **Verilator and GoogleTest**: 
  - The `f1_tb.cpp` file integrates with GoogleTest to structure the simulation as a unit test, it **only** output `a0` since all logic are implemented in [F1Assembly.s](../tb/asm/F1Assembly.s).
  - The assembly code is executed on a simulated CPU.
  - `vbuddy.cpp` connects to Vbuddy software on the host machine, allowing you to observe the `a0` register's LED patterns in a graphical interface.

- **Cycle-by-Cycle Execution**:
  Each iteration in `main.cpp`:
  - Advances the simulated clock by one cycle.
  - Reads the current `a0` register value and updates the Vbuddy display (a bar graph).
  - Continues until `max_cycles` is reached.

- **No Manual Intervention**:
  Once the simulation starts, the assembly code autonomously controls the LED pattern and timing. The test simply observes and logs these changes.
